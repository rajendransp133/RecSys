Book Recommendation System

The book recommendation system uses collaborative filtering (item-based SVD) and content-based filtering (CountVectorizer, cosine similarity) to provide personalized recommendations to users. It also provides recommendations based on the top 250 books, nearest neighbors, and popularity-based(yearly) recommendations.
